<ul>Craps is a simple game.
<li id="itemtest">The standard pass line bet has a house take of a mere 1.41% (i.e., the house takes 1.41 cents for every dollar wagered).
<li id="itemtest">The bet pays out 1 to 1 if a 7 or 11 are thrown on the first, or come out roll.
<li id="itemtest">The bet is lost if a 2,3, or 12 are thrown.
<li id="item">If any other number comes up, that number becomes the point.
<li id="item">The bet will now pay out (1 to 1) if the point number is rolled again before the shooter sevens out (rolls a seven).
<li id="item">An odds bet (which actually pays true odds) can be placed down after a point number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for those not paying attention) has been thrown on a come-out roll.
<li id="item">The odds bet further lowers the house take on the overall bet to less than 1%.
<li id="item">The size of the maximum odds bet varies with the casino.
<li id="item">The authors have seen 100x odds (i.e., the maximum odds bet can be 100 times the pass line bet),
<li id="item">lowering the house take to only 0.02%.
<li id="item">With such a pittance of a house take, this game seems like a gamblers dream.
<li id="item">The authors have spent much time at the tables with the idea of enjoying the exceptionally small amount of funds that would have to be given to the house.
<li id="item">But after much field research, our experimental efforts began to converge on one fundamental question: Why is it that we keep losing all of our money?
